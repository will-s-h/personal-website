## Overview

This project analyzes the plate tectonic stability and probability of future earthquakes across California using data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). A recurrent neural network (RNN) informed with energy dynamics, soil and rock composition, and historical earthquake data to quantitatively evaluate probabilties and risk for more informed infrastructure.

## Source Code

Soon to be open source on GitHub.
